### Academic Background  
My studies have covered various technologies, including Java, Python, and web development. However, my primary focus is on backend development and system integration.  

### **Subjects Studied**  

#### Development Interfaces  
- Working with **Windows Forms** to develop graphical applications.  
- Developed **games and interactive applications** as part of the coursework.  

#### Report Builder  
- Created **graphical reports** using Microsoft Report Builder on Windows.  

#### Services and Processes  
- The subject lacks structured instruction, so I have **self-taught** most of the concepts.  
- Gained experience in **server creation and management** independently.  

#### Data Access  
- Using **Java to interact with databases** and handle structured data.  
- Implementing **RESTful API services** to integrate with external systems.  

#### Multimedia Programming  
- Developing applications in **Android Studio** (without Kotlin).  
- Focused on multimedia-related projects and user interface design.
